== Running the application


To run the application, you must install the libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.
[source,sh]
pip install -r requirements.txt


Create a new file, .streamlit/secrets.toml, and copy the following text, adding your OpenAI API key.
[source,sh]
OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-..."
OPENAI_MODEL = "gpt-4"


Then run the `streamlit run` command to start the app on link:http://localhost:8501/[http://localhost:8501/^].
[source,sh]
streamlit run bot.py

====
Ensure you do not share or include your API keys in a git commit. The .gitignore file includes the .streamlit/secrets.toml file, so git wonâ€™t push the API key to Github.
